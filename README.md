# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## What I did

I modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## What to Expect

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN you open the Note Taker
THEN you are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN you click on the link to the notes page
THEN you are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN you enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN you click on the Save icon
THEN the new note you entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN you click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN you click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN you are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
